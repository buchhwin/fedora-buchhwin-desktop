# Sourced by install.sh, never executed — so there is no shebang, and the

# Phase: shellenv — the sysadmin toolbox, and the shell that makes it usable.
#
# ⚠️ WHY THIS PHASE EXISTS AT ALL. zsh has been in packages/dnf-core.txt since
# M1 and was never configured or made anybody's login shell; starship has been
# installed since M3 and was never initialised. Both are the most reliable
# shape of "forgotten, not decided" this project has: a package that is present
# and the one line that makes it do something missing. bluez, gnome-keyring and
# udisks2 were the same, and each of them was a bug.
#
# ⚠️ NOTHING HERE STARTS A SERVICE. It installs binaries, writes two files in
# $HOME and changes one field in /etc/passwd.

    # finding in itself.

    # names it, the settings window's error banner points at it — and on his
    # laptop `command -v bhctl` answered nothing, because ~/.local/bin was
    # empty. A rescue you have to know the source tree to call is not a rescue.
