# The generated niri configuration

`~/.config/niri/config.kdl` is **generated**. Editing it edits a file that is
overwritten the next time a setting changes. The source is
`~/.config/buchhwin/shell.json`; the generator is `shell/tools/niri.qml`.

```
~/.config/buchhwin/shell.json     you edit this
        │
        ├── tools/niri.qml   ──▶  ~/.config/niri/config.kdl
        │                    ──▶  ~/.config/environment.d/50-buchhwin.conf
        └── tools/render.qml ──▶  ~/.config/niri/colors.kdl   (colours only)
                             ──▶  gtk-3.0, gtk-4.0, kitty, qt6ct
```

Regenerate with `bhctl niri apply`. See what would change with `bhctl niri diff`.

## Why two files

`config.kdl` includes `colors.kdl`, so switching palette rewrites the colours
and leaves the keybindings untouched. Three rules make that split work, all
taken from niri's own documentation:

* `include` is **top level only** and **positional** — what comes *after* an
  include overrides it. The include therefore sits after our `layout` block.
* Sections **merge property by property**, so a colours file that sets only
  `border { active-color … }` does not disturb `gaps` or `width`.
* ⚠️ `layout { border {} }` means "enable the border" in the main config and
  **nothing at all** in an included file. Visibility (`on`/`off`/`width`) is
  therefore written **only** into `config.kdl`, and `colors.kdl` carries
  colours and nothing else.

## What is deliberately not generated

**No `spawn-at-startup` for our own shell.** The shell and the clipboard
watcher are systemd user units under `graphical-session.target`. Listing them
here as well would start a second copy of each — which is exactly what Fedora's
shipped niri config does with waybar.

**No colours.** See above.

## Environment variables are written twice, on purpose

niri's `environment {}` block does **not** reach the systemd and D-Bus
activation environment. Our shell runs as a systemd user unit, and every
program launched from it is its child — so a variable set only in `config.kdl`
would never reach them. The same list is therefore also written to
`~/.config/environment.d/50-buchhwin.conf`, which the systemd user manager
reads at login.

⚠️ `GDK_BACKEND` is deliberately **not** among them. From niri's documentation:
*"Do not set the `GDK_BACKEND` environment variable globally as this will break
the screencast portal."* GTK applications choose Wayland by themselves here.

## No window buttons — what that does and does not mean

| Toolkit | How |
|---|---|
| niri | `prefer-no-csd`, `border { off }`, `focus-ring { off }` |
| GTK 3 / GTK 4 / libadwaita | `gtk-decoration-layout=:` in the generated `settings.ini` |
| Qt | `QT_WAYLAND_DISABLE_WINDOWDECORATION=1` |
| Electron | `--ozone-platform=wayland` flags in `~/.config/*-flags.conf` |

**The header bar itself stays.** In a libadwaita application the header bar is
application *content*, not decoration: minimise, maximise and close disappear,
while search fields and path bars remain. No setting removes it, and pretending
otherwise would be a promise the desktop cannot keep.

## Keys

Every binding is generated from `keys.binds` in `shell.json`. They live in the
compositor rather than in the shell because niri has no protocol for
shell-owned shortcuts — which also means **they keep working when the shell is
dead**. Two are reserved for exactly that case:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Super+Shift+Return` | terminal |
| `Super+Ctrl+Shift+R` | restart the shell unit |

### Changed compared with the Hyprland predecessor

niri is scrolling column tiling. Four groups of keys had no equivalent and were
remapped to the nearest real meaning rather than silently dropped:

| Key | Was (Hyprland) | Now (niri) |
|---|---|---|
| `Super+Ctrl+←/→` | snap to left/right half | column narrower / wider (±10 %) |
| `Super+Ctrl+↑` | snap maximise | `maximize-column` |
| `Super+Ctrl+↓` | snap restore | cycle preset column widths |
| `Super+Shift+J/K` | toggle split direction | consume / expel window from column |
| `Super+P` | pin window | toggle floating |
| `Super+Ö` | scratchpad | focus the named workspace `scratch` |

Also different from the predecessor: `Super+arrow` moves **focus** and
`Super+Shift+arrow` moves the **window**, following niri's own convention.

**Minimising does not exist** in niri. Workspaces and the overview replace it.

### Reaching the island

Every page has a key, without exception — the bar is **off** in the default
setup, so a page you could only click on the bar would not be reachable at all.

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `Super+M` | media |
| `Super+N` | notifications |
| `Super+,` | quick settings |
| `Super+C` | calendar |
| `Super+Shift+N` | new appointment |
| `Super+T` | the system tray |
| `Super+Shift+E` | the session menu — lock, suspend, log out, restart, shut down |
| `Super+Ctrl+L` | lock straight away |
| `Super+Shift+W` | choose a wallpaper |
| `Super+Escape` | close the island |

⚠️ **`Super+Shift+E` used to be niri's `quit`, directly.** One keystroke, no
question, every unsaved thing gone. It opens the session menu now, and the menu
asks before anything irreversible — the second press is the feature, not the
list of buttons. Locking and suspending skip the question because both are
reversible, and a question people learn to dismiss without reading is what makes
the shutdown question useless too.

⚠️ **Lock is `Super+Ctrl+L`, not `Super+L`.** `Super+L` is already
focus-column-right in the vim group, and niri silently takes the last binding
for a key — so a duplicate is a shortcut that quietly stopped working.
`tests/niri-config.sh` fails on one now.

⚠️ **The brightness keys run `brightnessctl` first and tell the shell second**,
joined with `;` rather than `&&`. The screen has to brighten even when the shell
is dead, which is the one moment when not seeing the screen is worst.

⚠️ **Tray menus need a window to open against.** With the bar off, that window
is the island's own — which is why the tray page is a page and not a popup. If
you switch the notch off *and* the bar off, there is no tray at all, and that is
the honest consequence rather than a bug.

⚠️ These go through the shell's ipc socket, and `qs ipc call` takes **no
arguments** in quickshell 0.2.1 — `qs ipc show` lists `show(page: string)`
happily, but calling it with a page answers "The following argument was not
expected". So each page is its own parameterless verb:

```
qs -c buchhwin ipc call notch media
qs -c buchhwin ipc call notch collapse
```

`Super+M` was the predecessor's power menu. Nothing had to move in the end: the
session menu took `Super+Shift+E`, the key that used to log you out without
asking.

### The launcher, and the key that used to be missing

`programs.launcher` is gone. It was an empty argument list waiting to be filled
with the name of some other launcher, and the generator dropped the binding
rather than write a key that did nothing. The shell has its own launcher now, so
the key points at the shell instead of at a program:

    Super+D      qs -c buchhwin ipc call launcher toggle
    Super+Space  the same thing

Two keys for one surface, on purpose: `Super+D` is what niri's own default
config binds a launcher to, and `Super+Space` is what somebody coming from a Mac
will press. Neither is used for anything else.

## Traps that cost a debugging round

* **`spawn` takes one string per argument.** `spawn "kitty -e fish"` makes niri
  look for a binary with spaces in its name. Commands are argument *lists*
  everywhere in `shell.json`.
* **On the top level the node is `spawn-sh-at-startup`**, not `spawn-sh` —
  `spawn-sh` is a bind action. The wrong one is rejected outright, and a config
  that does not parse means a desktop with **no keys at all**.
* **libinput flags reject `false`.** `natural-scroll false` is a hard error,
  unlike most other niri flags. The generator omits a flag rather than writing
  it false.
* **KDL needs a terminator.** `layout { gaps 16 }` on one line fails; anything
  inline gets a `;`.
* **`binds {}` is not defaulted.** Leave it out and the desktop has zero
  keybindings — and `niri validate` still says the config is valid.
* **`niri validate` exits 0 on warnings.** Deprecated keys and out-of-range
  values pass silently, which is why `tests/niri-config.sh` also greps stderr.
* **niri writes its own default config if none exists** — the one that starts
  waybar. The installer must generate ours before the first login.
