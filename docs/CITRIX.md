# Citrix Workspace App

Citrix is the one place this desktop knowingly gives up its "Wayland only"
rule. That is a vendor constraint, not a design choice, and this page says
exactly what it costs so nobody discovers it during a work call.

## The constraint, in Citrix's own words

> **X11 or X.Org (Wayland isn't supported)**
> — [System requirements, Citrix Workspace app for Linux](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace-app-for-linux/system-requirements.html)

There is no Wayland backend and none announced. On this desktop Citrix
therefore runs under **XWayland**, and XWayland is installed **for Citrix
alone**. `bhctl doctor` lists every window still using XWayland, so the
exception stays visible rather than quietly spreading.

Two further facts worth knowing before you rely on it:

- **Fedora is not a supported platform.** Citrix supports RHEL, Ubuntu,
  Debian, openSUSE and Raspberry Pi OS. It installs and runs on Fedora, but
  you are outside the tested matrix.
- **Teams optimization is documented as "supported only on Ubuntu 20.04 or
  later".** It generally works elsewhere; it is simply not promised.

## Installation — `install.sh --with citrix`

Off by default, because most people do not need a 405 MB proprietary client.

The package **is** a normal RPM. What it is not is *in a repository*: it lives
only on citrix.com behind an Akamai-signed URL that is regenerated on every
page load and expires after about an hour. So there is no stable link a script
can hardcode, and `dnf install icaclient` will never work.

The installer therefore accepts either:

    install.sh --with citrix --citrix-rpm ~/Downloads/ICAClient-rhel-gcc-8-*.rpm
    install.sh --with citrix            # prints the download page and waits

Current package, verified 2026-08-04:

    ICAClient-rhel-gcc-8-26.04.0.105-0.x86_64.rpm     ~405 MB   the client

### Why it is installed with `--nodeps`

Fedora 44 no longer ships `webkit2gtk4.0`; only `webkit2gtk4.1` exists, and
the RPM asks for `libwebkit2gtk-4.0.so.37`. Citrix bundles its own copy at
`/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/Webkit2gtk4.0/webkit2gtk-4.0.tar.gz`, which
`integrate.sh` unpacks — so installing with `rpm -i --nodeps` and letting the
bundled WebKit serve the Self-Service GUI is the clean route, not a hack
around a broken package. Only `selfservice` and the `wfica` dialog use WebKit
at all; sessions launched from a browser never touch it.

The real dependencies are installed normally beforehand — all present in
Fedora 44: `gtk2 libcanberra-gtk2 libXaw libXp libsoup speex libcxx libcxxabi
libunwind libsecret libvorbis libxml2 gstreamer1 gstreamer1-plugins-base
gstreamer1-plugins-good libva alsa-lib pulseaudio-libs wget`.

## Teams optimization

`HdxRtcEngine` is the media engine that runs on this machine and takes Teams
audio and video out of the remote session. It ships **inside** the Workspace
App — there is nothing extra to install. Minimum client version is 2006; 2604
is far past that.

## What to expect, honestly

| | |
|---|---|
| **Multi-monitor** | Known broken under Wayland: the first screen is shown on both monitors. Works on X11. |
| **Clipboard** | Unreliable. Citrix writes the clipboard on focus loss, and an X11 client under Wayland is not always told it lost focus. Switching windows manually usually flushes it. |
| **HiDPI** | Citrix's DPI matching supports GNOME, KDE and Xfce only. niri is none of those, so expect XWayland's upscale on a HiDPI screen. |
| **Sharing your local screen from an optimized Teams call** | **Unverified, and structurally doubtful.** An X11 client under XWayland cannot see native Wayland surfaces. Citrix's documentation says nothing either way. Test it before you need it in a meeting. Sharing content from *inside* the Citrix session is unaffected. |

## The lighter alternative: Workspace for Web (HTML5)

If your Citrix environment exposes **Workspace for Web**, the HTML5 client in
Chrome is the better fit for this desktop: Chrome runs Wayland-native, screen
capture goes through `xdg-desktop-portal` and PipeWire — so sharing a Wayland
window actually works — and **Teams optimization is supported there too**
(Chrome m97+).

Its limits: no USB redirection (that needs the `ctxusbd` system daemon, which
has no browser equivalent), and multi-monitor is weaker than the native
client.

Whether it is available is **not a local decision** — your IT has to enable it
on StoreFront or the Gateway. Worth asking, because if the answer is yes, this
machine can stay almost entirely free of XWayland.
