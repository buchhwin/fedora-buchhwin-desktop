// The thing that makes "change the palette, everything follows" true.
//
// ⚠️ NOTHING DID THIS BEFORE, and the file that most needed it said otherwise:
// tools/render.qml's own header claims it runs "whenever the palette or a look
// setting changes (from the running shell)". Nothing in shell/ started it — no
// Process, no watcher, no Connections. Measured by grepping for every way a
// process can be launched.
//
// What that meant in use: pick a wallpaper, and the SHELL recolours instantly
// (QML bindings all the way down from Config to Theme), while GTK, Qt, kitty
// and niri sit on the old colours until somebody types `bhctl theme apply`.
// Half of the project's central promise, quietly untrue — and
// ui/notch/pages/WallpaperPage.qml even promised the other half in a comment.
//
// ⚠️ IT DOES NOT RENDER AT STARTUP. The files on disk were written the last
// time something changed; rewriting them on every login is a process spawn and
// a fistful of file writes to produce byte-identical output. So the first
// settled state is only RECORDED, and rendering happens on changes after that.
// "Nothing happens while nothing is happening" is the standard this project is
// held to.
