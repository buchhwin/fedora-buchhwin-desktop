// The answers this machine already knows, for the rows that used to be empty
// boxes.
//
// ⚠️ IT EXISTS BECAUSE THIRTY ROWS ASKED YOU TO TYPE SOMETHING THE MACHINE
// COULD HAVE SAID. His words: "überall wo es Vorschläge geben muss" — and the   // english-ok: the brief, quoted
// list is not a matter of taste. A screen name, an app-id, an installed
// program, an xkb option: every one of them is a fact about this computer, and
// every one of them was a text field where a typo produced no error anywhere.
// A mistyped app-id is not a warning, it is a window rule that never matches.
//
// ⚠️ ONE PLACE, NOT FIVE. `*.monitors` appears on four pages and `windows.*` on
// three; assembling the same list in each of them is how two of them end up
// disagreeing after somebody improves one. Everything here is a binding over
// services that already exist — no new process, no timer, nothing polled. The
// only cost is the scan Installed already does on demand.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT NEVER FILTERS, IT ORDERS. A filter tight enough to be useful is
// tight enough to be wrong: kitty carries no freedesktop category that says
// "terminal", and a browser installed by hand may carry none at all. Hiding
// such a program would put "Not installed here" under a program that is
// installed — a lie in the interface — whereas ordering only decides which
// eight are shown first, and typing narrows the rest.
