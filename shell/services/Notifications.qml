// Quickshell IS the server here — there is no dunst or swaync underneath, which
// is why `Config.surfaces.notifications` switching it off means notifications
// go nowhere at all rather than to somebody else's popup. That is a real
// consequence and it is written down rather than discovered.
//
// `keepOnReload` matters more than it looks: without it every shell reload
// throws away what is on screen, and a reload happens on every palette change.
