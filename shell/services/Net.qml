// The network: are we online, over what, how well, and what else is in range.
//
// ⚠️ WHAT THIS MODULE CANNOT DO, IN ITS OWN WORDS. From quickshell's
// src/network/wifi.hpp:113, read out of the source rpm rather than assumed:
// "Quickshell does not yet provide a NetworkManager authentication agent,
// meaning another agent will need to be active to enter passwords for unsaved
// networks." So `connect()` works for a network NetworkManager already holds a
// password for, and fails with NoSecrets for one it does not. Joining a new
// secured network therefore goes through `nmcli`, which is its own agent for
// the length of the call — see connectWithPassword() below. That is the honest
// division rather than a button that silently does nothing every time.
//
// ⚠️ THE SCANNER DOES NOT RUN IN THE BACKGROUND. `scannerEnabled` goes on while
// a list of networks is on screen and off again the moment it closes. A radio
// scan costs power on a machine that runs on a battery, and nothing reads the
// list when it is not being looked at.
//
// ⚠️ THE MODULE IS WIFI-ONLY, AND FINDING THAT OUT IS WHY THIS FILE HAS AN
// nmcli IN IT. `Networking.devices` reported zero devices on a machine nmcli
// showed as `ens18:ethernet:connected`. The reason is in the backend, not in
// the configuration: src/network/nm/backend.cpp:113-117 is
//
//     switch (type) {
//     case NMDeviceType::Wifi: dev = new NMWirelessDevice(path); break;
//     default: break;
//     }
//
// — so anything that is not wifi is dropped before a device object exists, and
// `DeviceType` accordingly has only None and Wifi (src/network/device.hpp:36).
// Believing the module would have meant a desktop that says "offline" while it
// is downloading over a cable, which is the exact class of silent wrongness
// this project keeps finding. So: wifi comes from the module, and whether the
// machine is on a network at all comes from NetworkManager itself.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT IS AN EVENT STREAM, NOT A POLL. `nmcli monitor` is one small
// long-lived process that says nothing until something changes — the same shape
// as `niri msg event-stream` in Niri.qml, and for the same reason: a timer
// asking every few seconds whether the network changed is a timer that wakes a
// laptop up all day to be told no.
//
// The test VM has no radio at all — one ethernet device, no /sys/class/bluetooth,
// no rfkill — so everything below the ethernet case is checked on real hardware
// or through BUCHHWIN_SHELL_FAKE, and never by looking at a VM and believing it.
