pragma Singleton

// A timer for working: start it, and the notch counts down instead of telling
// the time until it runs out.
//
// ⚠️ CALLED `Countdown`, NOT `Timer`. QtQuick has a `Timer` type, and a
// singleton of the same name would shadow it inside every file that imports
// services/ — including this one, which needs a real Timer to tick. Same reason
// the palette singleton is `Scheme` and not `Palette`.
//
// ⚠️ IT SURVIVES A RESTART OF THE SHELL, and that is the whole difference
// between a timer and a toy. `Restart=always` means a crash brings the shell
// back in two seconds; without the deadline written down, a twenty-five minute
// stretch would quietly become nothing. What is stored is the DEADLINE, not the
// remaining time — an absolute instant needs no clock running to stay true.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT TICKS ONLY WHILE IT RUNS. The Timer below is stopped when nothing is
// counting, so the idle desktop has no repeating work of its own — which is the
// rule this project measures itself against.

    // require of a beep. pw-play is part of PipeWire, which this desktop
    // already runs, and it played the file with no display at all.

    // down would be the whole notification. A real message survives that: it
    // arrives as a toast AND stays in the notifications tab, so a timer that
    // went off while you were in another room is still findable afterwards.

    // We are the notification server ourselves, so this arrives at our own
    // toast surface — measured on the VM, the test messages came through.
