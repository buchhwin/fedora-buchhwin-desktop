pragma Singleton

// The weather, from Open-Meteo.
//
// Chosen because it needs no API key. That is not a convenience — a key would
// have to live either in this public repository, where it would be revoked, or
// in a setup step nobody would complete. A service that works the moment you
// type a town name is the only kind that gets used.
//
// Two requests, both plain HTTPS:
//
//   geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=…   town  → coordinates
//   api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=…       coords → weather
//
// ⚠️ IT DOES NOT OWN THE PLACE. That lives in services/Location.qml, because a
// location is a property of the machine and three things want it — this, the
// sunrise/sunset that will drive automatic light/dark, and gammastep's night
// light. Set the place once, anywhere, and this follows: it is a binding, so
// choosing "Passau" in the settings window changes what the quick panel shows
// in the same instant, with nothing to keep in step.
//
// Fetched hourly, and only when a place is set. Weather does not change faster
// than that, and this runs on a battery: a service that polls because polling
// is easy is exactly what the desktop is not allowed to do.
