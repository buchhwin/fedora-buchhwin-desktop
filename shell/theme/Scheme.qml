// The active colour palette.
//
// A palette is 26 semantic colour names — see palettes/SCHEMA.md. They are the
// only hand-authored colour data in the project; everything visible is derived
// from them in Theme.qml. Drop a JSON file in palettes/ and it appears
// everywhere, with no code change.
//
// Loading is asynchronous. Anything that reads `colors` before `ready` turns
// true gets the fallback below, never an error and never a blank screen — a
// desktop that cannot draw because a file was slow is not a desktop.
//
// ONE palette is not hand-written: "wallpaper" is derived from the image that
// is currently set. It is still an ordinary palette file in the ordinary
// folder, so nothing downstream knows the difference — and that is deliberate,
// because the alternative (a second search path for user palettes) was tried
// and broke loading for all eleven shipped palettes, twice.
//
// The derived palette is therefore both READ and WRITTEN through the single
// FileView below. Not two views on one path: that is the trap this project has
// now paid for three times. One object owns the file, so a read cannot race a
// write, and `watchChanges` carries the new colours through the whole shell in
// the same process.
//
// The cache is what makes a wallpaper survive a restart. On start the file is
// loaded like any other palette — colours are up instantly, with no flash of
// the fallback — and only if its `source` no longer names the wallpaper that
// is actually set does the image get re-read. Choosing a wallpaper writes one
// key in shell.json; everything else follows from that on the next start.
