// The card is a pane of glass like every other floating surface, so a palette
// change reaches it without it knowing anything about palettes.
//
// ⚠️ The timer lives HERE rather than in the service, and that is what keeps
// the shell idle when nothing is happening. A service-side timer would have to
// exist whether or not anything was on screen, or poll to find out; a timer
// inside the delegate exists exactly as long as the card does, which is
// seconds at a time.
//
// Hovering pauses it. A message you are in the middle of reading must not
// disappear from under your eyes — and hover is the only signal we have that
// you are reading it.
