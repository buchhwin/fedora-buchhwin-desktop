// The launcher's window: a pane in the middle of the screen.
//
// ⚠️ THE MIDDLE, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN A LAYOUT DETAIL. Everything
// else this shell opens hangs from the notch, and the notch steps aside while
// it is up. The brief names this surface as the exception: a launcher in the
// centre leaves the notch where it is, so the clock and the media pill stay
// readable while you look for a program.
//
// It is therefore not a notch page and does not touch `Ipc.page` — see the note
// on `Ipc.launcher`.
//
// ⚠️ Exactly as big as what it draws, like every other surface here. From
// niri's own layer-rule documentation: it "has no way of knowing about
// invisible margins, and will draw the shadow behind the entire surface". A
// full-screen window with a centred card would get a screen-sized shadow and a
// screen-sized blur, which is what the notch's coloured halo was.
