// The system tray, as a page of the island.
//
// The tray already lives on the bar. It has to live here as well, and that is
// not duplication — the bar is OFF in the default setup, and the rule this
// shell is built to is that no function may be reachable only through a surface
// the user has switched off. Every bar function needs a key and an ipc verb too.
//
// ⚠️ A tray MENU needs a window to open against. On the bar that is the bar's
// own surface; here it is the island's, handed down through `hostWindow`.
// Without it a right-click does nothing at all, silently — which is why the
// plan reserved a separate popup host for this. It turned out not to be needed:
// the island is a real window and it is present exactly when this page is.
