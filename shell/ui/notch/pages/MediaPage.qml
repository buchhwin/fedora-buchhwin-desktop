// ⚠️ A CARD WITH THE ARTWORK BEHIND IT, from the reference
// (2026-08-06/vorlage-control-center.png): the cover fills the whole card, the
// output device sits small along the top, the title and artist sit on it, a
// round button holds the right, and a progress bar with skip buttons runs along
// the bottom.
//
// ⚠️ THE COVER IS DIMMED, NOT BLURRED. A live blur is a full-screen shader pass
// every frame the card is visible, on a laptop, for a decoration — and the
// reference's cover is dark and low-contrast, which a scrim reproduces for the
// cost of one rectangle. Album art is also not chosen to have text read off it,
// so the scrim is doing legibility work rather than only style work.
