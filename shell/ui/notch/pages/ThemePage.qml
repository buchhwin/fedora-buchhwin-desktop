// The theme menu: every palette on offer, each card drawn in the palette it
// offers.
//
// Reference: 2026-08-06/vorlage-theme-menue.png — three columns, a short bar in
// that palette's accent across the top of each card, the name under it, the
// active one ringed in the accent, the next row cut off so it reads as
// scrollable, and a header that says only "Theme".
//
// ⚠️ THE COLOURS ARE READ OUT OF THE FILES. Eleven hex values typed into this
// page would be exactly the mistake the menu is selling against: the palettes
// would drift from their own preview, and the twelfth palette somebody drops
// into theme/palettes/ would appear as a grey box. Each card owns a FileView on
// its own JSON and paints itself from it.
//
// ⚠️ AND THAT IS ALSO WHY THE LOADING LIVES HERE RATHER THAN IN THE SERVICE.
// Services.Themes lists names; holding all eleven palettes' 26 colours would
// keep eleven files' worth of state alive for the whole session so that a menu
// could look right for the four seconds it is open. A card exists only while
// the page does, and its FileView goes with it.
//
// ⚠️ A CARD IS NOT `Pill` OR `Tile`. Both of those paint themselves from the
// ACTIVE theme's tokens, which is right everywhere else and wrong here: the
// entire point is that a card does not look like the rest of the shell. This is
// the one file in ui/ allowed to take colours from somewhere other than Theme,
// and tests/no-literals.sh is untroubled by it because there are still no
// literals — the values come from a file at run time.
