// A value between nothing and everything: icon, track, percentage.
//
// Volume and brightness are the same object with different words, and writing
// them twice is how two things that should move identically start to drift —
// one gets a thinner track, the other keeps the old step size, and nobody
// notices until they are side by side in the quick settings.
//
// ⚠️ THE TRACK USED TO BE FOUR PIXELS TALL in everything except the control
// centre, and it was reported as "die Regler sind extrem blöd gemacht". Four     // english-ok: quoted brief
// pixels at scale 1 is a hairline: you cannot see where the value is without
// looking for it, and you cannot grab it at all — the handlers had already been
// moved onto a taller invisible item precisely because the visible thing was
// unusable. That is the shape of a control that has given up.
//
// The reference for the new one is One UI 8, asked for by name: a thick rounded
// track where THE FILL ITSELF IS THE HANDLE. There is no knob, because a knob
// is a small target inside a large one — the same fault this repo fixed in Pill
// — and because a bar that is entirely filled reads as "all the way" far more
// directly than a dot at the right-hand end.
//
// It grows while you hold it. That is not decoration: it is the only feedback a
// control without a knob can give that it has you, and One UI does exactly this.
