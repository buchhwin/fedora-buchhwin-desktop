// The one rounded container everything in the shell sits in.
//
// It exists so that "a thing on the bar" has exactly one definition of its
// corner radius, padding and hover behaviour. Every value comes from Theme; a
// literal here would be caught by tests/no-literals.sh, which is the point —
// the tripwire is not bureaucracy, it is what keeps a palette switch total.
//
// ⚠️ THE TAP TARGET IS THE PILL, WHICH IS WHY `clicked` EXISTS. Children handed
// to a Pill land in `inner`, an Item sized to `childrenRect` — so a TapHandler
// written inside a Pill used to attach to THAT rather than to the pill. Measured
// on a tab reading "Media": pill 68 x 29, tap target 44 x 21, leaving 1050 px²
// — more than half the pill — highlighted on hover and dead to the click. That
// is exactly the "I click it and nothing happens" it was reported as. The
// handler therefore lives here, once, and no call site declares its own.
