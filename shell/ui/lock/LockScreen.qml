// The lock screen. Its own process — see shell.qml for why that is a safety

// ⚠️ WHAT HAPPENS IF THIS CRASHES. The ext-session-lock protocol says a
// compositor must keep the session locked behind a blank screen when the
// locking client disappears without unlocking. So a fault here leaves you at a
// blank locked screen and needing a TTY — inconvenient, and the correct
// direction to fail in. The opposite, a crash that unlocks, is what running
// this inside the shell would have risked.
//
// ⚠️ IT LOCKS ON STARTUP AND EXITS ON UNLOCK. There is no "hide" state. A lock
// screen that is running but not locking is a process that looks like security
// and is not.
