//
// Left: a search field over named rows gathered under headings. Right: back and
// forward, then the page's symbol, heading and one explaining line, then the
// settings themselves as rows separated by space rather than by lines.
//
// ⚠️ THE TEN PAGES OF THE REFERENCE BECAME TWENTY-ONE, and that is the fix
// rather than a departure. The reference named ten; two of them then grew to 55
// and 43 rows, which is two thirds of every setting in the shell sitting in two
// unstructured columns. "aktuell ist alles unübersichtlich und echt schlecht"    // english-ok: quoted brief
// was about those two pages. Nothing here is longer than seventeen rows now.
//
// Between them every setting in shell.json still has exactly one row — which is
// what tests/setting-rows.sh counts by reading and tests/pages.sh counts by
// building, so "everything is settable" is two numbers that have to agree
// rather than a belief.

    // `bhctl doctor` measures that path. The service guards itself against a
    // second run, so opening the window ten times still costs one.

    // `source` is a relative URL, which quickshell resolves through its virtual
    // filesystem — proven by shell.qml, which boots the entire shell that way
    // (`source: "ui/Shell.qml"`). A wrong path is now loud: Loader.status goes
    // to Error and says so on screen, instead of drawing an empty page.
    //
    // ⚠️ TEN PAGES BECAME TWENTY-ONE, and `section` is why that is an
    // improvement rather than a longer list. Appearance carried 55 rows and
    // System 43 — two pages holding two thirds of every setting, each an
    // unstructured column. Nothing here is longer than seventeen rows, and the
    // sidebar gathers them under three headings.
    //
    // ⚠️ Every icon name goes through tests/icons.sh, which MEASURES THE GLYPH
    // rather than trusting the name: "Material Icons Round" is missing more
    // names than anyone expects, and a missing one renders as an 800 px
    // fallback box instead of failing.
