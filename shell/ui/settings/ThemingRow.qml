pragma ComponentBehavior: Bound

// One program, one line, four states side by side.
//
// ⚠️ THIRTEEN NEARLY IDENTICAL ROWS WERE THE WALL HE MEANT. As SettingRows they
// were a label, an explaining line and a full-width dropdown each — about
// ninety pixels a program, so four of the thirteen fitted on screen and the
// answer to "what is kitty set to" was three scrolls away. He chose the compact
// table over pills, and the reason is the same one that made the dropdown
// exist: a page where every row looks alike has to be scannable down a column,
// not readable line by line.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS NOT A `SettingRow` KIND, and that is deliberate. A `kind` is how a
// value is edited; this is how thirteen rows are laid out NEXT TO each other,
// which is a property of the group rather than of any one row. Making it a kind
// would have put table geometry — the label column width, the shared segment
// widths — inside a component that knows nothing about its neighbours.
//
// ⚠️ BUT IT KEEPS SettingRow'S ONE RULE, and everything depends on that: it
// reads and writes through ONE dotted `key` and nothing else. tests/
// setting-rows.sh anchors on `^ *key:` to count rows, so these thirteen still
// answer for their thirteen settings; and the failure that rule exists to
// prevent — a line labelled "kitty" that writes `theming.qt` — is still
// impossible here, because there is no second place for the two to drift.
