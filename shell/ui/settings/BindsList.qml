// Key bindings — all of them, searchable, and the one handle that unfreezes a
// machine.
//
// ⚠️ IT EDITS NOW, AND THE CLASH CHECK IS THE REASON IT TOOK A SECOND PASS.
// Two bindings on one key is a KDL parse error, and niri does not start with a
// config it cannot parse — so a rebinding that is only checked afterwards costs
// a session, on the machine of somebody who was changing a shortcut. The check
// runs in Config.bindClash BEFORE anything is written, and the row says which
// binding is in the way rather than just refusing.
//
// ⚠️ AND IT WRITES AN OVERRIDE, NOT THE WHOLE LIST. See the note beside
// Config.binds: `binds` is all-or-nothing, so rebinding one key by saving the
// resolved list would freeze the other sixty-seven and every default added
// later would never reach this machine. That has happened here once already.
//
// ⚠️ AND "RESET" IS NOT A PROCESS CALL. `bhctl binds reset` exists and does this
// from a terminal, but from here the whole operation is writing an empty list:
// Config.qml treats an empty `binds` as "the built-in set", so emptying it IS
// restoring the defaults. Spawning bhctl to do one assignment would put a second
// writer on shell.json, which is the one thing that file does not have.
//
// ⚠️ THE FROZEN LIST IS A REAL FAILURE THIS PROJECT HAS SEEN. A shell.json once
// carried 63 bindings copied from the defaults of the day, because `binds` used
// to have those defaults inside the adapter — so "the file wins when it says
// anything at all" froze them forever, and every new default afterwards was
// invisible on that machine. Migration 7→8 removes such a copy when it is
// exactly ours; this is the button for when it is not.
