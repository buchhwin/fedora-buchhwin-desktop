// Keyboard — layout, variant, options, and how fast a held key repeats.

// ⚠️ THE LAYOUT REACHES niri AND NOTHING ELSE. The login screen and the TTY are
// not the session, and the login screen is where the password is typed FIRST —
// the installer sets the system layout separately for exactly that reason.
