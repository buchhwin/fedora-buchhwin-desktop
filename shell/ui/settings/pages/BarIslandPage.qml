// Bar & Island — the page his reference screenshot actually shows.
//
// Every one of the five sliders in that picture is here: notch flare, bar
// height, collapsed width, expanded height, minimum expanded width.
//
// ⚠️ WITH ONE HONEST DIFFERENCE. The reference labels the fourth one "Expanded
// height", and `notch.expandedHeight` NO LONGER EXISTS — migration 9→10 removed
// it, because it was a minimum applied to every page and produced dead space
// above and below anything shorter (measured: media 161→138, tray 161→138,
// calculator 161→120). The value in this shell that answers to the same idea is
// `notch.hoverHeight`, the height the island grows to under the pointer, and
// that is what the row is labelled. Quietly printing "Expanded height" over a
// different key would be the exact failure this whole design is built to make
// impossible.
//
// Fifteen rows here, not eighteen. `surfaces.notifications`, `surfaces.osd` and
// `surfaces.wallpaper` switch other surfaces on and off and belong on the pages
// that own them — Notifications, Control Center and Appearance. The hot corners
// stay, because a screen corner is an edge affordance like the bar and the
// notch. tests/setting-rows.sh has all three in its PENDING list, so none of
// them can be forgotten.
