// Other programs — one state each for the programs we colour.
//
// Three states per program was the brief — follow the scheme, a neutral grey, or
// leave the program alone — and "Follow" makes four: take whatever the default
// above is set to.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A TABLE NOW, AND THAT WAS HIS CHOICE. As thirteen SettingRows this
// page was a label, an explaining line and a full-width dropdown per program —
// about ninety pixels each, so four of the thirteen fitted on screen and
// "what is kitty set to" was three scrolls away. Every row looked like every
// other row and none of them could be compared with its neighbour, which is
// precisely what a table is for.
//
// ⚠️ THE THIRTEEN ROWS ARE STILL WRITTEN OUT, and the reason has not changed
// with the layout. tools/render.qml reads these names with an explicit switch,
// on purpose; a Repeater here would be the same shortcut on the other side, and
// the moment a name is added in one place and not the other, one program stops
// being themed and nothing says so. They are also one `key:` per line because
// tests/setting-rows.sh anchors on `^ *key:` to count them.

        // heading and the card — while the fourteen rows are one level further
        // in. A walk does not have to know that.
        //
        // ⚠️ AND IT MATCHES ON `programRow`, which ThemingRow declares for this
        // one purpose. The two obvious discriminators are both wrong: `states`
        // is a property of EVERY QML Item, so it separates nothing, and the
        // "theming." prefix also catches `theming.enabled` and `theming.mode` —
        // a switch and the default state. Today those two live in another group
        // and would be out of reach anyway, which is exactly the kind of safety
        // that disappears the day somebody rearranges the page.
        //
        // ⚠️ The walk is a plain JS closure rather than a QML method calling
        // itself through its own id: written that way, `table.collect` resolved
        // to the SettingGroup instead of to the method and the call threw. A
