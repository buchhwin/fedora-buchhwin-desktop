// Clock & Date — how the time and the date are written, everywhere they are.
//
// ⚠️ THE SECTION BEHIND THIS PAGE DID NOT EXIST, and that is why the page was
// empty for a round. Four places built the time by hand with their own copy of
// the same pad helper — the collapsed island, the widened island, the bar and
// the lock screen — so there was nothing to offer here that would have reached
// all four. common/Clock.qml is now the single reader, and these settings are
// what it reads. A row over a key nothing reads is a control you can move that
// does nothing, and the audit found five of those.
