// Lock Screen — what is on the screen while the session is locked.
//
// ⚠️ IT IS A SEPARATE PROCESS (`BUCHHWIN_MODE=lock`). It reads shell.json
// itself and learns nothing from the running shell, so a change here reaches it
// the next time it starts — which is the next time you lock. That is not a
// caveat to work around; it is why the lock screen survives a shell that has
// crashed.
//
// The brief asks for a large clock, the date, a round avatar and nothing else
// until you touch a key. Each of those three can go; the clock cannot, because
// then it would be a black rectangle you have to trust.
