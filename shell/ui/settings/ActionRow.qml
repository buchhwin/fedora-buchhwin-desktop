// A row that DOES something, rather than one that holds a value.

// ⚠️ NOT A `SettingRow` WITH A NEW `kind`, and the reason is a tripwire rather
// than taste. Every SettingRow carries a dotted path into shell.json, and
// tests/setting-rows.sh checks that each of those paths is a real key with a
// real reader — that is what stops a slider labelled one thing from writing
// another. "Export settings" has no key, so it would have had to be an
// exception in that check, and an exception is exactly how the next row with a
// wrong key gets in.
//
// It reads like a SettingRow on purpose: same label, same one-line elided hint,
// same spacing. Only the control on the right differs.
