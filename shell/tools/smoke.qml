//
// ⚠️ THIS IS THE CHECK A LINTER CANNOT DO. qmllint reads files; it does not
// build the object graph. It cannot see a missing qmldir entry, a singleton
// shadowed by a Qt type, or a `Connections { target: <singleton> }` that
// crashes on a singleton still being constructed — and every one of those has
// turned this desktop black at some point during development. The plan called
// for this from M1 and it was never written, so the CI has been linting and
// calling it proof.
//
// ⚠️ IT DOES NOT START THE SURFACES. A PanelWindow needs a Wayland compositor
// with wlr-layer-shell, which a CI container does not have. What it does start
// is everything BELOW the surfaces — config, migrations, theme, every service —
// which is where the singleton faults live. The surfaces themselves are checked
// on the VM, by looking at them.
//
// The plan names this file shell/tests/headless.qml. It is here instead because
// quickshell treats the folder of the file it is given as the config root: a
// second root would give the tools a different import graph from the shell, and
// then the thing being tested is not the thing that runs. Same reason there is
// only one entry point — see shell.qml.
