// Do the two new controls write what they say?
//
// ⚠️ EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THESE ROWS IS CHECKED BY READING, and reading cannot
// see this. tests/setting-rows.sh proves every row names a real key;
// tests/suggestions.sh proves every suggesting row has a source and that the
// source answers. Neither touches the part that actually changes the file:
// clicking a chip, clicking a suggestion, typing an argument.
//
// ⚠️ AND ONE OF THOSE THREE CARRIES A PROMISE THAT IS EASY TO BREAK AND SILENT
// WHEN IT IS. `programs.terminal` is ["kitty", "-e", "btop"] — a program and its
// arguments, in order. Picking a different terminal from the suggestions must
// keep the arguments. Lose them and the key binding still works, still spawns a
// terminal, and simply stops opening btop; nothing anywhere says why.
//
// ⚠️ IT CALLS THE CONTROL RATHER THAN CLICKING IT, and the earlier version of
// this note said clicking was impossible on the test machine. That was wrong —
// measured afterwards: a real click on the settings window works, and the three
// things that had made it look broken were a locked session, ydotool's
// `--absolute` on a device with no ABS axes, and niri's overview standing open
// because a pointer move had crossed the top-left corner. The recipe that works
// is in buchhwin-desktop-shots/INDEX.md.
//
// Calling the control is still the right choice HERE, for a plainer reason: a
// check that drives the window has to know where every control is on screen, so
// it breaks whenever the page is rearranged — and it cannot run at all without
// a session. This one runs headless, in the CI, against a throwaway config.
//
// Runs against a throwaway XDG_CONFIG_HOME; tests/row-writes.sh sets it.
