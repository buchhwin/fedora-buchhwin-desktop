// Numbered migrations for ~/.config/buchhwin/shell.json.
//
// This does NOT walk back the rule stated in Config.qml. Adding a key still
// needs nothing: the adapter default answers for it, and a file written last
// month keeps working. A migration is only for the two cases a default cannot
// cover — a key that was RENAMED, and a key that was REMOVED. In both, the old
// name is already sitting in somebody's file and only code can know what it
// meant.
//
// It runs on the RAW JSON, deliberately, and this is the part that is easy to
// get wrong: JsonAdapter drops every key it does not declare. So a migration
// reading through the adapter cannot see the old field it exists to rescue —
// by the time the adapter has parsed the file, the evidence is gone. Read the
// text, transform the object, write it back, and only then let the adapter look.
//
// The chain is almost empty on purpose. It is here before the first rename so
// that the first rename is not also the day we discover we need a mechanism.
