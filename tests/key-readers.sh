# Every setting in shell.json is read by something.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE AXIS THAT FOUND A KEY I HAD ORPHANED AN HOUR EARLIER.
# `notch.expandedHeight` sized the covers in the wallpaper picker; rewriting that
# page as a grid (commit 3added8) took its last reader with it. Nothing said a
# word — the key stayed in Config.qml, stayed in shell.json, and simply stopped
# doing anything. Somebody sets it, nothing happens, and there is no error to
# search for.
#
# It is the mirror of the debt this project already names in the other
# direction — btop was themed with no way to reach it — and it is the direct
# prerequisite for the settings window (M8), where every one of ~80 rows will be
# a new reader. A row that writes a key nothing reads is a switch that lies.
#
# ⚠️ WHAT COUNTS AS A READER, and why it is not just `Config.<section>.<key>`:
#
#   * `programs.terminal` and its five siblings are never named directly. They
#     are resolved through `Config.program("@terminal")` — a STRING lookup, which
#     no search for the identifier can see. Six false positives on the first run.
#   * generators read some keys through a local alias (`var l = Config.look`),
#     so `l.gapsIn` is a real reader of `look.gapsIn`.
#
# So a key counts as read when its NAME appears anywhere outside Config.qml —
# after a dot, in a string, in a fingerprint. That is deliberately generous: this
# check exists to find keys that appear NOWHERE, which is unambiguous. A tighter
# rule would spend its life explaining itself.

cat <<'WHY'

  Nothing outside shell/config/Config.qml mentions these. They are still written
  to shell.json, still shown by anything that lists settings, and they do
  nothing at all — a switch that lies rather than one that is missing.

  Two ways out, and the first is usually right:
    * give it back its reader, if the behaviour is still wanted
    * delete the key AND add a migration step, because it is already sitting in
      somebody's shell.json

  Do not silence this by mentioning the name in a comment. The check treats any
  occurrence as a reader on purpose — being generous is what keeps it free of
  false alarms — and that trust is the whole of its value.
