#
# The wallpaper's colour scheme, and the one promise that matters about it:
# what you pick is still there after a restart.
#
# That promise has two halves, and both are checked here rather than assumed:
#
#   * shell.json remembers the image — one key, written atomically
#   * the derived palette is a CACHE keyed on that image, so a restart loads
#     colours from disk instead of re-reading a 6000x3750 PNG
#
# ⚠️ That cache lives in XDG_STATE_HOME, NOT in the shell tree. It used to sit
# in theme/palettes/ beside the eleven palettes that ship, which put generated
# user state into a source checkout — one `git pull` or one deploy that mirrors
# the tree and somebody's colours are gone. This test pins the new location so
# it cannot drift back.
#
# The cache is the part that can rot silently. If it were not keyed on the
# source, changing the wallpaper would leave the old colours in place for ever
# and the only symptom would be "the theme did not change" — which reads as a
# missing feature, not as a bug. So case 2 and case 3 below are the real test:
# same image must NOT rewrite, different image MUST.
#
# ⚠️ Needs a real image. ImageMagick is not assumed; the images are written as
# tiny uncompressed PPMs, which Qt reads without any extra plugin.
#
# ⚠️ And it runs against a COPY of shell/. The derived palette is written into
# the shell's own folder — that is the deliberate design, because giving Scheme
# a second search path broke loading for all eleven palettes twice. The cost is
# that a desktop running on this machine and a headless tool share one cache
# file: measured here, the live shell noticed the test's write, saw a `source`
# that did not match ITS wallpaper, and re-derived over it mid-test. Testing a
# copy keeps the test honest without asking anyone to shut their desktop down.
