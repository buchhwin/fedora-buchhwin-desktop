# A row may only be an empty text box if there is a reason written down.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE PERMANENT ANSWER TO A COMPLAINT, not a style rule. Thirty of
# the hundred and sixty-five rows asked you to TYPE something the machine
# already knew: which screens exist, which app-ids are running, which programs
# are installed, which xkb options xkb has. His words were "überall wo es          # english-ok: the brief, quoted
# Vorschläge geben muss" — and the reason it matters is not convenience. A         # english-ok: the brief, quoted
# mistyped app-id is not an error anywhere: niri takes the string, never matches
# a window with it, and the window you wanted blurred is simply not blurred. No
# log line, no red check, nothing to notice.
#
# ⚠️ IT IS CHECKED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, like the PENDING list in
# tests/setting-rows.sh and for the same reason. A row left as free text must be
# named below with a reason; a row named below that has since GAINED
# suggestions fails just as loudly. That is what stops a list like this rotting
# into a set of excuses — the only way to keep it green is to keep it true.

# ROWS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO STAY A PLAIN TEXT BOX, each with the reason.
#
# ⚠️ IT IS DOWN TO THREE, and the three are not a backlog — they are the rows
# where a list would be the wrong answer rather than a missing one. Everything
# else that was a text box now has a control that fits its value.
#
#   location.name          ⚠️ THESE THREE ARE THE ONLY ONES LEFT, AND THEY STAY.
#   location.lat           There is no list of places this machine knows, so
#   location.lon           there is nothing to suggest — what there is, is a
#                          search, and ui/common/LocationPicker.qml is it. It
#                          sits above these three rows on the same page and
#                          fills all three at once, which is exactly why it is
#                          NOT a SettingRow: a row reads and writes one dotted
#                          path, and that rule is what gives
#                          tests/setting-rows.sh its meaning.

# source returns nothing draws a box with no pills under it, which looks exactly
# like a machine that has no fonts — and that is how this control was reported
# broken once already, on a machine a headless probe found 109 fonts on at the
# same moment. So the services are asked.
#
# Which lists are allowed to be empty is decided HERE rather than in the tool:
# `players` is empty when nothing is playing and `workspaceNames` is empty until
# somebody names a workspace, both correct. `monitors` being empty would be a
# desktop that cannot see its own screen.
#
# ⚠️⚠️ AND THE PROBE ITSELF NEEDED A CONTROL BEFORE IT COULD BE BELIEVED. Its
# first run reported `monitors=0` and it was NOT a fault in the code — under
# QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen there are no Wayland outputs, so Quickshell.screens
# is legitimately empty. Measured both ways at the same moment:
#
#   offscreen                monitors=0
#   the real session         monitors=1, Virtual-1
#
# A red line believed at that point would have gone into a handover as "the
# screen list is broken", and the next round would have started by looking at
# the wrong thing. So the screen list is only required where screens exist, and
# where they do not the line says so rather than passing quietly.
