#
# install.sh must run from top to bottom.
#
# ⚠️ THE FAULT THIS EXISTS FOR. `lib/20-base.sh` referenced `DRY_RUN`, which the
# predecessor defines and this repository does not — the line came across with
# the `defaultyes` block it was wrapped in. Under `set -u` (lib/common.sh:9) an
# unbound name inside `(( ))` is fatal to a non-interactive shell, so phase_base
# exited 127 halfway through and desktop, apps, fonts, cursors, shell, services
# and summary never ran. A fresh machine got the base packages and nothing else.
#
# It survived a green CI because CI never ran install.sh — every other suite
# reads the repository or starts quickshell. `shellcheck -S warning` did not
# report it either, which is the second reason this check reads the exit code of
# a real run rather than trusting a linter.
#
# ⚠️ WHY THIS IS SAFE TO RUN ANYWHERE. Three separations, and all three matter:
#
#   1. Every command that would touch the machine — sudo, dnf, systemctl, rpm,
#      flatpak, curl, ping — is replaced by a stub earlier on PATH. The `sudo`
#      stub exits without running its arguments, so a `sudo tee /etc/...` writes
#      nothing; it still consumes the heredoc, which is what keeps the parse
#      identical to a real run.
#   2. HOME and the four XDG directories point into a temporary tree, so the
#      files the installer legitimately writes land there.
#   3. It runs a COPY of the repository. phase_shell writes
#      shell/theme/palettes/index.txt back into REPO_DIR, and a test that edits
#      the working tree it is testing is a test nobody can trust twice.
#
# preflight is skipped on purpose: its whole job is to `die` on a machine that
# is not Fedora 44, which is most machines this ever runs on, including the CI
# runner. It is covered separately below, where only the failure MODE is
# checked rather than the exit code.
