# Restarting the shell must not lock somebody out of their machine.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS A MEASURED LOCKOUT, not a hypothetical one. The lock screen used to
# be a plain child process of the shell, so it lived in
# buchhwin-shell.service's control group — and that unit is
# KillMode=control-group. On a locked session:
#
#   locked                        3 qs processes   LockedHint=yes
#   restart buchhwin-shell        2 qs processes   LockedHint=yes
#                                 and typing the password does nothing
#
# niri keeps the session locked when the locking client dies, which is correct
# and is the entire security property of ext-session-lock. What is left is a
# machine with no way in short of another terminal. The paths that reach it are
# ordinary: the rescue key, `bhctl update`, and Restart=always after a crash.
#
# ⚠️ IT DOES NOT LOCK YOUR SCREEN TO FIND OUT. A test that locks the machine it
# runs on is a test nobody runs twice, and it would lock his laptop the first
# time he ran the suite. So the MECHANISM is measured against a dummy unit that
# sleeps, in exactly the arrangement the real one is in, and a text check ties
# Idle.qml to that mechanism. Both halves are needed: the behaviour check alone
# would stay green if Idle.qml went back to a bare child, and the text check
# alone would be a green line about a string.
