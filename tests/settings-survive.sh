# Axis 10: a setting survives a shell restart.
#
# shell.json is the store and the shell is supposed to be the only thing that
# writes it, so "it survives" sounds like it cannot fail. It can, and this
# project has the scars: Migrations.qml rewrites the raw JSON on every start,
# and step 7→8 exists precisely because a key had frozen 63 keybindings into
# somebody's file for ever. A migration that drops a key it does not recognise,
# or a JsonAdapter type that cannot read its own output back, both look exactly
# like this — the value is gone the next morning and nothing said a word.
#
# ⚠️ ONE KEY OF EACH SHAPE, not one key. The failure is type-shaped: the
# `list<int>` that tests/config-shape.sh bans could not be read back at all
# while looking perfectly fine on the way in. So: a bool, an int, a real, a
# string, and a list of strings.
#
# ⚠️ NEEDS A RUNNING SHELL — it restarts the thing it is testing. Not in CI, for
# the same reason tests/ipc-effect.sh and tests/surfaces.sh are not.
