  A `property var` inside a nested JsonObject makes quickshell segfault when the
  file supplies that key — about half the time, and it recovers on its own, so
  it looks like "sometimes the shell does not come up" rather than like a bug.

  Two ways out, both fine:
    * move it to the top level of the adapter, next to `binds` and `outputs`
    * give it a real element type — list<string>, and ONLY list<string>; see
      the third check below for why a numeric list is not an option

  Moving a key needs a migration; see shell/config/Migrations.qml step 5 -> 6,
  which is the one this check was written for.

  These sections exist in the adapter but nothing exposes them. Add one line
  each to the block at the top of shell/config/Config.qml:

      readonly property alias <name>: adapter.<name>

  Without it the section is not missing, it is `undefined` — and the error
  surfaces in whatever reads it, which is never where the mistake is.

# No list of numbers anywhere in the adapter.
#
# ⚠️ MEASURED, AND IT CONTRADICTS WHAT THE TOP OF THIS FILE USED TO SAY.
# The note above claims "list<string> and list<int> are safe at any depth". That
# is true of CRASHING — a numeric list does not segfault. It also does not work.
# JsonAdapter cannot deserialise one at all:
#
#   list<string> nested (windows.blurred)   0 warnings
#   list<string> top level (autostart)      0 warnings
#   list<int>    nested (timer.presets)     1 warning
#   list<int>    top level                  1 warning
#   list<real>   nested                     1 warning
#
#   "Failed to deserialize property presets: expected QList<int> but got
#    QVariantList"
#
# So it is the type, not the depth, and it fails for a VALID list as much as for
# a null one. `timer.presets` was the only one, and every preset anybody wrote
# in shell.json was being thrown away in favour of the defaults, with one line
# in the journal as the only sign. Strings, converted at the reader.
# ⚠️ AND EVERY GROUP IS DOCUMENTED. docs/CONFIG.md carried eighteen of the
# twenty-nine top-level groups, so nine of them — cursor, gpu, brightness,
# clock, motion, media, lock, terminal, clipboard — were settable, had rows in
# the settings window, and appeared in no document at all. That is the sort of
# gap nobody trips over: the code works perfectly and the reader concludes the
# feature does not exist.
# ⚠️ A DEFAULT THAT NAMES SOMETHING ON THE MACHINE MUST BE SOMETHING WE PUT
# THERE. `cursor.theme` shipped as "Breeze_Dark" with a comment claiming it
# "ships with Fedora's breeze-cursor-theme" — a package that appears in none of
# the lists under packages/. So every fresh machine handed niri a theme name
# that does not resolve, niri fell back to its own pointer at its own size, and
# it was reported as "the cursor is far too big and cannot be changed".
#
# The check is deliberately about what the INSTALLER provides, not about what
# happens to be on the machine running the test: a CI container has no cursor
# themes at all, so asking /usr/share/icons here would be green for the wrong
# reason on every runner and red for the wrong reason on a workstation.

  JsonAdapter cannot read these back. The key will appear to work — the default
  is used and the shell runs — but nothing anybody writes in shell.json ever
  reaches it.

  Use `list<string>` and convert at the reader, as timer.presets does, and add a
  migration so existing numbers become their own text instead of being lost.
