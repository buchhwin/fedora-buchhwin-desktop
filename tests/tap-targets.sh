# The third tripwire: no TapHandler inside a Pill.
#
# `Pill` hands whatever it is given to an inner Item sized to `childrenRect`, so
# a TapHandler written inside a Pill attaches to THAT — not to the pill. The
# hover highlight still covers the whole pill, so the thing lights up under the
# pointer and then ignores the click everywhere except on the letters.
#
# Measured on the quick panel's "Media" tab before this was fixed: the pill was
# 68 x 29 px and the tap target 44 x 21, leaving 1050 px² — more than half of
# it — lit and dead. It was reported as "I click it and nothing happens", which
# is exactly what it was, and it had been that way in every Pill in the shell.
#
# Pill now carries `clicked` and `rightClicked` of its own, so call sites write
# `onClicked:` and there is nothing to get wrong. This is what stops the old
# shape coming back the next time somebody adds a button in a hurry.
#
# ⚠️ It is a structural check, not a taste one. TapHandler is right and normal on
# a Rectangle, an Item or a delegate; the fault is specifically a handler in a
# container that re-parents its children.

# Same fallback as tests/english.sh, and for the same reason: the working copy

# to be — is silently left out. Found on 07.08.2026 when a new shell/common/
# singleton became the sole reader of four settings and key-readers.sh reported
# all four as having none: the advice it printed was "delete the key", which
# would have deleted four working settings. Untracked-but-not-ignored is the
# corpus that matches what is actually on disk.

  A TapHandler declared inside a Pill attaches to the Pill's inner Item, which
  is only as big as its contents — so most of the pill highlights on hover and
  ignores the click. Use the pill's own signals instead:

      Pill {
          interactive: true
          BarText { text: "Media" }
          onClicked: doTheThing()          // and onRightClicked for a menu
      }
