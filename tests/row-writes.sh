# The two new controls have to write what their labels promise.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE HALF THAT CANNOT BE READ. setting-rows.sh proves every row names
# a real key and suggestions.sh proves every suggesting row has a source that
# answers — both by looking at the source. Neither touches the moment the file
# changes: a chip added, a chip removed, a program picked.
#
# ⚠️ AND ONE PROMISE HERE IS SILENT WHEN IT BREAKS. `programs.terminal` is
# ["kitty", "-e", "btop"] — a program and its arguments, in order. Picking a
# different terminal from the suggestions must keep the arguments; lose them and
# the key binding still works, still opens a terminal, and simply stops opening
# btop. Nothing logs it, no other check sees it, and you find out weeks later.
#
# ⚠️ IT DOES NOT USE SYNTHETIC INPUT, and that is measured rather than lazy: the
# settings window could not be driven with ydotool on the test machine at all —
# pointer motion arrives and hovers highlight, clicks and keystrokes do nothing,
# while the same ydotool typed a password into the lock screen minutes earlier. A
# check built on that would have gone quietly green-because-nothing-happened.
# The control is called directly instead, one function below where a click lands.
#
# It runs against a throwaway XDG_CONFIG_HOME, so nothing here can reach real
# settings — and that is checked rather than trusted.
