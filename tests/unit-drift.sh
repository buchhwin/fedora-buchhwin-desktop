# The installed systemd units must still be what the installer would write.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE CHECK FOR "the code was right and the machine was old". The
# unit template gained `ExecStartPre=- … bhctl prune` after quickshell was found
# leaving one instance directory per run behind — in a tmpfs, so in RAM. The
# line went into lib/70-services.sh and the installed unit on the test machine
# never got it, because the installer had not run since. Measured when the
# memory was finally looked at: 1213 directories, 50 MB of RAM, and a repository
# whose source said the problem was solved.
#
# Nothing compared the two. Every file the installer writes once can drift the
# same way — and drift is silent by construction, because the thing that would
# tell you is the file that is out of date.
#
# ⚠️ IT COMPARES AGAINST THIS CHECKOUT. `ExecStartPre` names an absolute path
# into the repository, so a unit pointing somewhere else is reported too. That
# is not a false alarm: it means the desktop starts from a different copy of
# this code than the one being tested, which is worth knowing at least as much.
