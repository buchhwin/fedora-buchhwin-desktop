# Every name the lock screen uses has to exist in the lock screen.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE OTHER HALF OF tests/lock.sh, AND IT CATCHES THE ONE THAT COST
# FOUR ROUNDS. `Keys.onPressed` wrote into `field`; the field is called `input`.
# Building the file cannot find that: the handler only runs when a key is
# pressed, and then QML throws a ReferenceError into a log nobody reads, drops
# the character, and the password box stays empty. Four handovers in a row said
# "nobody has ever typed the password" while the reason sat in one identifier.
#
# So this reads rather than runs: collect every name the directory DECLARES —
# ids, properties, signals, functions, function parameters, `var`s — and report
# every `something.` that is none of them.
#
# ⚠️ ONLY shell/ui/lock/. The same check over the whole shell would be a
# false-alarm generator: a surface legitimately reaches ids in files it is
# nested into, and a check nobody trusts costs more than it saves. The lock
# screen is two files and one process, which is exactly the shape this works on.
#
# ⚠️ AND COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED FIRST. Without that, the check reports the prose
# that explains it: a sentence ending in "…the words." looks exactly like
# `words.` to a regular expression. This project has now made that mistake three
# times, and this is the file where it would have been funniest.

  A name used here exists in no file under shell/ui/lock/. In QML that is not
  an error you see: the binding or handler throws a ReferenceError, the value
  stays at its default, and everything looks almost right. `field` instead of
  `input` swallowed every keystroke on the lock screen for four rounds.

  If the name really does come from somewhere else, it belongs behind a type
  or a singleton — those start with a capital letter and are not checked here.
