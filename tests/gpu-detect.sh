# What the installer thinks is a graphics card.
#
# `gpu_devices()` in lib/10-gpu.sh decides whether the NVIDIA branch runs at
# all, so a wrong answer either installs a driver on a machine that has no card
# for it, or leaves the target laptop without one. It reads sysfs rather than
# calling lspci — pciutils is in no package list, sysfs parses a number instead
# of English, and it hands back the PCI address that /dev/dri/by-path/ names its
# render nodes after.
#
# ⚠️ THE FIXTURE THAT MATTERS IS THE FOURTH ONE. An NVIDIA laptop GPU brings an
# HDMI audio function on the same card: same vendor 0x10de, class 0x0403 instead
# of 0x0300. Matching on the vendor alone counts it as a second GPU, and "this
# machine has two NVIDIAs" is the kind of wrong that then gets acted on — the
# hybrid message, the render device list, the PCI address in the report. So the
# audio function is not a curiosity in this file, it is the reason for it.
#
# Runs anywhere: it builds its own /sys tree and needs neither hardware nor root.
