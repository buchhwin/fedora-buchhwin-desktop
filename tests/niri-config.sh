# No key may be bound twice.
#
# niri takes the LAST binding for a key and says nothing about the one it
# dropped, so a duplicate is a shortcut that silently stopped working. The
# predecessor accumulated several of these — a duplicated Super+Tab is in the
# list of things deliberately left behind — and it happened again the moment a
# conventional Super+L was added on top of the vim navigation group.
#
# ⚠️ THIS CHECK CANNOT ACTUALLY FAIL, and that was measured rather than
# suspected: the generator (tools/niri.qml, bindsSection) drops a duplicate
# before writing the file, so the output is deduplicated by construction. A
# second Mod+K was added on purpose and this stayed green while the binding
# quietly did not exist. The real check is in tools/smoke.qml, against
# Config.keys.binds. This one is kept as the second net — it would catch a
# duplicate the generator itself introduced, which the other cannot see.
# Every layer rule must name the radius its surface actually DRAWS.
#
# ⚠️ THIS IS THE CHECK FOR "the corners of all the panels are a weird red".
# `background-effect` belongs to the SURFACE, and niri clips the blur to
# `geometry-corner-radius`. The generator used to pass `look.rounding` for every
# namespace — but that is the BASE the radii derive from, not a radius anybody
# paints: the panes draw `Theme.radiusLg`, which at rounding 16 is 21. The five
# pixels between the two came out as a crescent of RAW blurred wallpaper at each
# corner, and raw means through `blur { saturation }`. Measured on the VM before
# the fix: panel interior r−b = +2, crescent r−b = +138, i.e. more saturated
# than the wallpaper itself.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT DOES NOT RE-COMPUTE THE FORMULA. Multiplying rounding by 1.33 here
# would pass whatever the theme does, including the same mistake — the check
# would be a mirror. Instead the two independent producers are compared: the
# token dump says what QML draws, the generated config says what niri is told.
# Both must be run with the SAME shell.json, or they are answering different
